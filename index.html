           <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11">Hello Everyone!!I am Jelon II L. Billion but you can call me Jelon for short . I am a shy person and I find 
		   it difficult to interact with other people but now that I am 18 years of age, I am trying to overcome this
		   shyness that I have in me. I am just doing it slowly/steady because I know that it is hard from the start.</p>
		   
		   <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11">My Guiding Principle in my life is the verse Proverbs 3:5-6, that says "Trust in the Lord with all your
		   heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make
		   straight your paths."</p>
		   
		   <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11"><b>How are you alike and different from the other?</b></p>
		   <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11">I am the same as people that we are all sinners and nothing from this world but thanks to God, He
		   sacrificed His Own Son just to save as sinners and all we have to do to be saved is to accept Lord Jesus
		   Christ as our Lord and Saviour of our life. We became different to each other because each of us have our
		   calling that God wants us to do.</p>
		   
		   <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11"><b>Enumerate your accomplishments, little or unimportant it may seem, which you and your family are
		   proud of.</b></p>
		   <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11">1. When I was in grade 6, it was my first time playing chess in meets and I was thankful to God that
		   I've reached the Provincial Meet in my first time participating.
		   2. In my grade 7-8, I competed in many tournaments and I became the winner in all of the
		   participants that ages from 13 and below and I am thankful to God.
		   3. In grade 9, I competed in  the Palarong Pambansa and as always, I am very thankful to God that He
           gives me this talent and skills.
           4. As I graduated in  Senior High School, my family were very proud of it. I thank God for all the
           achievements that I have achieved.</p>

           <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11"><b>What are your dreams and future plans?</b></p>
           <p style="text-align:center; color:black; font-family:Georgia; font-size:11">For now, I don,t have a dream and just waiting for GOd's plan for me. But while I am waiting. I am now
		   studying in college and I am currently taking the course Bachelor of Science in Computer Science because
		   it involves the use of computer which is very needed nowadays and from the future.</p>
